# FizzBuzz TODO List
FizzBuzz is a well-known programming exercise for learning the basics of coding.
1. If a number is divisible by 3, output "Fizz".
2. If a number is divisible by 5, output "Buzz".
3. If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, output "FizzBuzz".
4. For all other numbers, output the number itself.

# We will proceed with the following steps:
1. Write a TODO list.
2. Write a single test.
3. Run all tests and confirm that the new test fails.
4. Make a small change.
5. Run all tests and confirm that all tests pass.
6. Refactor the code to remove duplication.
